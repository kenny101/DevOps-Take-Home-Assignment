# Task 3 Details

In this task I'll be using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which allows us to configure and manage cloud instance easily. I've mostly deployed for web environments so we'll be configuring a simple aws instance with nginx installed for reverse proxying a web application.

For security purposes the ami-ID and SSH IP has been redacted. Modify ami_id, ssh_key_name and ssh_cidr_block for proper access. Other variables such as AWS region and CIDR block can be configured as needed.
